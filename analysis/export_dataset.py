"""
Export the collected choices as a LABELLED RANKING DATASET.

This script does not fit weights. It turns what participants did into the
standard learning-to-rank shape so that any downstream model - LambdaMART,
a linear scorer, a conditional logit, whatever you decide later - can be
trained and compared on identical data.

One "query" (qid) = one participant working one task. Its candidates are the
whole hotel pool for that task's anchor: exactly one is labelled 1 (chosen),
the rest 0. Candidates the participant filtered out are still exported, marked
`shown=0`, because "not shown" and "shown and rejected" are different facts and
collapsing them would bias anything trained on the result.

Outputs (into analysis/out/ by default)
    dataset.csv        one row per candidate - the human-readable master file
    dataset.jsonl      same rows, one JSON object per line
    dataset.ltr.txt    RankLib / LibSVM / XGBoost-rank format:
                           <label> qid:<n> 1:<f1> ... 6:<f6> # <hotel_id>
    groups.txt         group sizes, in qid order (XGBoost `set_group`)
    dataset_card.md    row/participant counts, feature list, known caveats

Usage
    python analysis/export_dataset.py                # reads ./data/*.jsonl

| Queries (participant x task) | {stats['n_queries']} |
| Rows (candidates) | {len(export)} |
| Positive labels | {stats['n_positive']} |

Attention-check tasks excluded from the dataset: {stats['attention_tasks_skipped']}.
Participants who failed the attention check: {stats['failed_attention_participants']}

## Files

| File | Format |
|---|---|
| `dataset.csv` | one row per candidate, all columns |
| `dataset.jsonl` | same rows as JSON |
| `dataset.ltr.txt` | `<label> qid:<n> 1:.. 6:.. # <hotel_id>` (RankLib / XGBoost) |
| `groups.txt` | group sizes in qid order |
| `rooms.csv` / `rooms.jsonl` | stage 2: one row per room offer |
| `rooms.ltr.txt` / `rooms_groups.txt` | stage 2 in ranking format |

## Features (in `dataset.ltr.txt` order)

{chr(10).join(f'{i}. `{f}`' for i, f in enumerate(FEATURES, start=1))}

`position` is the 1-based rank the hotel was displayed at, or 0 if the
participant had filtered it out. `shown` in the CSV distinguishes the two.

## Stage 2 — room choice within the chosen hotel

{room_section}

Features (in `rooms.ltr.txt` order):

{chr(10).join(f'{i}. `{f}`' for i, f in enumerate(ROOM_FEATURES, start=1))}

Its own qid space, unrelated to the hotel `qid`. Groups are small (2-5) and
vary in size, because the choice set is whatever the chosen hotel actually
offered. `price_delta_lkr` is measured against the cheapest offer in the SAME
hotel, so it is a within-hotel contrast and carries no hotel-level price
information — that lives in the stage-1 `economic` component.

The reason to fit this: `price_delta_lkr` is in rupees, so the ratio of any
other coefficient to the price coefficient is a willingness-to-pay. That is
what lets the five stage-1 weights be reported on a monetary scale rather than
only up to an arbitrary scale factor.

## Caveats a user of this data must know

- **Position is confounded with proximity.** Each task's list opens sorted by
  distance to the task anchor, so the nearest hotels are also the ones at the
  top. `position` is exported so this can be modelled or corrected; a model
  trained without it will attribute the effect of rank to the spatial feature.
- **`spatial` and `accessibility` are strongly correlated** (~0.9 across the
  pool: in Colombo, being close and being quick to reach mostly coincide).
  Treat them as one location signal unless you have a design that separates
  them. Observed correlations at or above 0.5 in this export:
{chr(10).join(corr_lines) if corr_lines else '  - none'}
- **Choice sets are participant-dependent.** Search and filters were available,
  so the candidates actually on screen differ between participants for the same
  task. `shown`, `n_shown`, `final_sort`, `final_query` and `final_max_price`
  describe what each participant had narrowed the list to.
- **Repeated task.** `t10` deliberately repeats `t2`; `repeat_of` marks it. Use
